"""Real-Codex semantic submit regression for issue #436.

The browser-level compose tests prove WebSocket framing, but that did not prove
that Codex interpreted the final carriage return as Submit.  On Windows,
Codex's fallback paste-burst detector reclassified the launcher's already
bracketed bulk write and intentionally converted the first Enter to a newline.

This test launches a real Codex ConPTY with the compatibility override, pastes
``/quit`` through the production framing, and asserts that one carriage return
actually exits the TUI.  It makes no model request.  Machines without Codex (CI
included) skip cleanly.

Codex 0.144.x adds a "Hooks need review" startup modal whenever ``~/.codex``
carries new or changed lifecycle hooks (issue #462), and a separate
"Update available!" startup modal appears whenever a newer Codex CLI release
exists (issue #485).  Either interstitial paints over the composer and
captures Enter, so the probe must clear both before the composer it is meant
to test even exists.  The submit contract itself is unchanged — once the
composer is reached, one bracketed paste plus one carriage return still
submits.  We therefore dismiss each modal when present (non-mutating choices:
"Skip" for the update prompt, "esc to close" for the hooks panel — neither
persists a preference or trusts anything) rather than adjusting the submit
sequence.

Timing (issue #493): the CR is sent only after the pasted text has visibly
rendered in the composer, and the exit wait is a polled 15 s budget — a fixed
3 s budget flaked ~2/20 under concurrent load (typical submit->exit is
~870 ms, but the full pre-ship gate can push it past 3 s).
