"""Issue #610: a slow ``POST /sessions`` create must not freeze every other
in-flight WS pump on the shared event loop.

``SessionManager.create``/``create_remote`` call ``PtyProcess.spawn`` (or
``subprocess``/PowerShell ``Start-Process`` for a remote session) — a
blocking OS call. The ``POST /sessions`` handler previously called these
synchronously (no ``asyncio.to_thread``), so any concurrent create shares
the single event loop with every already-attached terminal's ``_pump_to_client``
loop: while a create blocks, no other coroutine — including delivering a
live session's queued PTY output to its WS — gets scheduled. Under a
multi-worker orchestration run (several sessions being spawned close
together), this is a real, measurable contributor to the "terminal opens
blank and never paints" class of symptom investigated in #610 (prior
mitigation: the client-side watchdog in #624).

This proves the handler no longer blocks the loop: a slow (simulated)
create running concurrently with another coroutine that must keep ticking
on a tight schedule must not stall that coroutine for anywhere near the
create's own duration.
