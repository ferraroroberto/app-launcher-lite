"""Headless VT screen mirror for full-screen agents (issues #432, #435).

``VtSnapshot`` parses a PTY's byte stream through a headless ``pyte`` screen
and renders the current frame back to ANSI on demand, so the session-host
can serve a (re)connecting client the *current* frame without ever
resizing the PTY — the SIGWINCH a resize fires is exactly what makes a
ratatui agent re-emit its entire transcript (issue #430).

``test_render_round_trips_wide_chars_and_sgr`` pins the two real bugs found
while building this against a captured Codex stream (see the round-trip
probe in the issue): a naive per-row ``\\r\\n`` join shifts the whole frame
down by one line (xterm's deferred-autowrap state), and not skipping a wide
character's continuation cell shifts every column after it.

``test_render_prepends_bounded_scrollback_history`` and friends pin issue
#435: a plain ``pyte.Screen`` only ever knows the current frame, so a cold
reconnect landed on exactly one screen with nothing to scroll into.
``VtSnapshot`` now uses ``pyte.HistoryScreen`` and prepends a bounded window
of real scrollback (plain scrolling text, not absolute-positioned) ahead of
the current frame.
