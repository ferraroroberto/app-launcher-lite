"""Regression pin for commit 142e2b4 / issue #28 (live terminal WS reconnect).

The bug: iOS aggressively suspends backgrounded PWAs; uvicorn's ping
timeout then closes the half-dead WebSocket and the overlay was left
frozen on "Disconnected." until the user manually re-opened the
session. The fix factors the ws setup into ``connectWs(t)`` and
re-runs it after non-final close codes with 1s/2s/4s/8s backoff.

This test exercises the JS half of the fix by:
  1. Wrapping ``window.WebSocket`` in an init script so the test can
     observe every WS the SPA opens (no product change).
  2. Opening the terminal via ``?terminal=<sid>`` deep-link.
  3. Force-closing the open WS from the page (code 1005). Per
     ``terminal.js:113-114`` this is the "iOS-suspend" path — same
     code reached when uvicorn's ping timeout fires.
  4. Asserting the SPA opens a fresh WS and that input sent on the
     fresh socket reaches ``webapp/sessions/<sid>.log``.
