"""Cache hygiene regression net (validates Part 1/5, commits 35caad4 + bf76d0d).

The four invariants pinned here mirror the four pillars of issue #30:

1. ``/`` is always revalidated (Safari, especially PWA-installed, used to
   serve a stale ``index.html`` and reference a ``?v=<old hash>`` script
   that no longer existed — symptom: empty Model/Effort segmented
   controls on iPhone after #26 split deleted app.js).
2. ``/static/*.{css,js}`` is immutable for a year so the cache bust above
   actually pays off (no re-download until the hash changes).
3. The ``?v=<hash>`` stamped into ``index.html`` matches
   ``compute_asset_hashes(STATIC_DIR)`` — *this* is the test that catches
   "forgot to invalidate after editing a JS file" because a stale stamp
   diverges from the on-disk content's fleet hash.
4. ``/api/version`` returns the three keys the Settings build-line and
   tray ``ℹ️ Status`` rely on.

Non-browser: uses ``requests`` against the live tray. Parametrising over
both Playwright projections would just hit the same loopback URLs twice
from the same headless engine — no extra signal — so the test runs
once and skips on the duplicate projection.
