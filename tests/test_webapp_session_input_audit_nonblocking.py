"""Issue #661: the session router's HTTP audit writes must not stall the loop.

#660 threaded the audit writes in this router's **WS proxy** path (see
``test_webapp_ws_proxy_audit_nonblocking.py``). The identical synchronous
``open``/``write``/``close`` on ``webapp/sessions/*.log`` was still called
unthreaded from five HTTP handlers in the same file, so the defect #660 fixed
stayed reachable through a different door.

``POST /api/claude-code/sessions/{sid}/input`` is the one that matters most:
it is the path the Board's dispatch bar and any orchestrator use to drive
sessions, so it fires at message rate against every session under a
multi-worker run. The webapp runs a **single** uvicorn worker
(``app/webapp/event_loop.py``), so a slow write there freezes every other
live session's in-flight WS output — the "terminal opens blank and never
paints" class from #610.

Exercises the real ``session_input`` coroutine directly rather than through
``TestClient``, which runs the ASGI app on a separate portal thread and so
cannot demonstrate same-loop contention — the same reason the #660 test
drives ``_proxy_websocket`` by hand.
