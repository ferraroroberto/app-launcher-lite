"""``PtySession.write`` — chunk-and-pace path for long writes (#64).

pywinpty 3.0.3's ``PtyProcess.write()`` wraps an asynchronous ConPTY input
pipe; on long single writes the tail was being silently dropped (#64), and
the previous attempt to compensate via a return-value-driven retry loop
caused massive byte amplification (#13 revert). The fix is to keep small
writes one-shot and split larger payloads into ~512 B chunks with a brief
inter-chunk pause so the pipe drains between writes.

These tests pin the wrapper's behaviour against a fake PTY that records
every call, so a future refactor can't quietly reintroduce either
truncation or the retry-loop regression.
