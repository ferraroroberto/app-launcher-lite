"""Drift guard: every runtime ``subprocess`` spawn suppresses the console (#688).

The fleet-wide convention ("Subprocess spawns must suppress the console window
(Windows)") was consolidated into ``src/subprocess_flags.py`` by #585 — but the
sweep stopped at ``src/`` + ``app/`` and never reached ``scripts/``, so a chain
of three console windows kept flashing on every tray-driven webapp restart on a
Tailscale machine. Nothing caught it, because an unsuppressed spawn only
misbehaves under a *console-less* parent (the ``pythonw`` tray and its
descendants) — never in the terminal where the tests run.

So the gate is static: parse the runtime trees and assert every
``subprocess.<spawn>(...)`` passes ``creationflags`` resolving to the shared
``NO_WINDOW`` / ``NO_WINDOW_NEW_GROUP`` constant. ``tests/`` is deliberately
out of scope — it runs from a real console and several cases assert on spawn
kwargs. Sibling implementation: ``fleet-config``'s
``tests/acceptance/spawn_scanner.py``.
