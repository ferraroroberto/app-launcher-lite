"""Issue #610 AC1 — five-concurrent-session load probe for "terminal opens
blank and never paints".

#610 was filed off a phone screenshot taken during a five-worker
orchestration run: one session's terminal painted nothing at all. Three
mitigations shipped (#624's client-side "no response yet" watchdog, #639's
``POST /sessions`` offload, #660's WS-proxy audit-write offload), but AC1 —
*"a reproduction, or an explicit statement that it could not be reproduced
under a five-session load with the steps that were tried"* — stayed open
across all three, because every one of them was proven with a synthetic
single-call probe rather than a real concurrent load.

This is that missing load test, and the steps it tries are the ones the
original report describes:

* a **real** session-host ASGI app on a **real** single uvicorn event loop
  (the whole failure class is same-loop contention, so a ``TestClient`` —
  which runs the app on a separate portal thread — cannot show it);
* five **real** ConPTY spawns issued as a concurrent burst through the real
  ``POST /sessions`` handler;
* five **real** WebSocket clients, each attaching the instant its own create
  returns, so late creates in the burst race already-attached pumps exactly
  as they did in the reported run;
* a per-session unique sentinel, so "painted" means *that session's own*
  bytes arrived — the assertion covers the cross-wiring failure mode from
  the issue's follow-up comment (a session's exchange returning another
  session's content), not just emptiness.

The child (``_pty_paint_child.py``) prints its sentinel immediately instead
of being a real agent: a 3-5 s ``claude`` startup would swamp the very
latency this measures, and the transport under test is agent-agnostic.

An event-loop ticker runs alongside the burst. It does not gate the test —
the user-visible contract is "every terminal paints its own first frame" —
but its worst observed gap is reported in every failure message, because
that number is what distinguishes a loop-contention regression (the #639 /
#660 class) from a spawn or transport failure.
