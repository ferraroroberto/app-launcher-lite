# Manually restart the app-launcher session-host on :8456 (issue #615).
#
# tray.bat --restart deliberately EXCLUDES :8456 to protect live PTY
# sessions (project-scaffolding#35) -- so a change under src/session_host.py
# or app/session_host/ is not live until this process restarts, and nothing
# else restarts it automatically. This script is the one supported,
# documented way to do that: an explicit, operator-initiated action, never
# a side effect of a normal ship.
#
# THIS KILLS EVERY LIVE CODING-TAB SESSION ON THIS MACHINE. There is
# no drain, no idle check -- every PTY dies immediately. Only run this at a
# clean boundary (no live sessions mid-work), never unattended, never as
# part of building or testing a session-host change itself.
#
# Usage:
#   pwsh -File scripts/restart-session-host.ps1 -Confirm
#   (bare, with no -Confirm, prints the warning and exits 1 -- does nothing)
