/* Spike #246 — pure state machine for the hands-free voice loop.
 *
 * THROWAWAY BY DESIGN — but RETAINED FOR NOW (#258). This module (and its
 * sibling spike-voice-loop.{html,js} + tests/e2e/test_spike_voice_loop.py +
 * docs/voice-loop-spike.md) is a de-risking spike: prove whether a continuous,
 * no-tap voice conversation loop is viable inside the iOS Safari PWA, or
 * whether it has to fold into the native iOS hub (#40). The gate is answered,
 * but the set is kept as the live reference until the kanban/board view and the
 * orchestrator (#245) voice mode land — delete it only once those ship. See
 * docs/voice-loop-spike.md for the retention decision.
 *
 * The loop is one turn repeated forever, hands-free after a single Start tap:
 *
 *   listening → (speech) → capturing → (silence) → transcribing
 *     → (transcript) → narrating → (narration ends) → listening …
 *
 * with two escapes: a **barge-in** (user speaks while narration plays →
 * narration stops, jump back to listening) and a **forced gesture** (iOS
 * refuses to re-arm the mic or play audio without a fresh user tap → pause
 * until the user taps Resume). That forced-gesture count is the whole point
 * of the spike: a loop that needs a tap every turn is not hands-free.
 *
 * This file is PURE — no DOM, no audio, no network, no timers. It owns only
 * the state transitions, the per-turn latency arithmetic, and the running
 * tallies, all driven by events the controller (spike-voice-loop.js) feeds in
 * with injected timestamps. That keeps the loop *logic* deterministically
 * unit-testable (tests/e2e/test_spike_voice_loop.py drives it through the
 * window.__voiceloop seam with fakes) — the iOS audio-gating questions it
 * exists to answer can only be measured on a real device, but the wiring that
 * sequences the turns is proven here, off-device.
 *
 * Each event returns an INTENT string telling the controller what to do next
 * (arm the mic, start a capture, transcribe, narrate, stop, pause…). The FSM
 * decides *what* should happen; the controller performs the audio/network side
 * effect and reports back with the next event. One-way data flow, no I/O here.
