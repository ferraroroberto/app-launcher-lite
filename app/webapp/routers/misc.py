    The session-host is deliberately excluded from ``tray.bat --restart``'s
    reclaim sweep (project-scaffolding#35, to protect live PTYs), so it can
    keep running code that is days old with nothing else surfacing that —
    exactly what happened to #611's fix on 2026-07-27. ``session_host.stale``
    compares the session-host's own loaded ``git_sha`` (captured once, at
    *its* process start) against ``deployed_sha`` — the repo's resolved
    default remote branch (``origin/HEAD``, normally ``origin/main``),
    resolved fresh on every call. This is **not** ``head_sha`` (below): #641
    found that comparing against the *live checkout's current branch tip*
    reports a false ``stale_relevant=false`` whenever the primary checkout
    transiently sits on an unrelated feature branch (e.g. a worker occupying
    the tree mid-issue) that never contained the merged fix being checked
    for. ``deployed_sha`` instead tracks what's actually mergeable/shippable
    regardless of what the on-disk checkout happens to be doing right now.
    ``session_host.stale`` is a raw fact — it flips ``true`` after *any* merge
    anywhere in the repo, even one that never touched the paths the
    session-host actually loads (#635). ``session_host.stale_relevant`` scopes
    that: ``true`` only when a declared session-host path (``CLAUDE.md``'s
    ``## session-host`` block) was touched between the loaded sha and
    ``deployed_sha`` — this is the field that should actually drive a restart
    decision. ``session_host: {"reachable": false}`` when the session-host
    can't be reached at all; both ``stale`` and ``stale_relevant`` stay
    ``None`` (never a confident answer) whenever either sha, or the scoped
    diff itself, can't be resolved — e.g. a non-repo test env, an unknown
    host sha, or no resolvable ``origin`` remote.
