Split off ``app/webapp/routers/board.py`` (issue #691, a `/codebase-audit`
maintainability finding) — the same god-router split ``jobs.py`` and
``sessions.py`` already carry. ``board.py`` owned two unrelated concerns: the
Board tab's read-only column assembly, and this ~650-line chief state machine
(spawn, resume, label self-heal, chief-managed marking, settings). Mounted on
``board.router`` via ``include_router`` so ``app/webapp/server.py`` still
registers one ``board.router``.

Imports flow one way: this module depends on
:mod:`app.webapp.routers.board_spawn` (the shared spawn-then-type mechanics)
and never on ``board.py``, which imports *this* — so there is no cycle. The
chief-label self-heal lives here rather than in ``board.py`` even though
``GET /api/board`` calls it: it is chief-domain logic, and the poll reaching
into this module is one call, not a shared concern.

The chief is a normal PTY session (label="chief") spawned in the fleet-config
checkout — that cwd is what loads the fleet-only /chief skill tier and keeps
app-launcher's own project context out of it. The server ships zero chief
prose: the spawn types only "/chief", so the brain stays versioned in
fleet-config. Two triggers hit the ensure endpoint: the first chat-mode message
(lazy) and the manual Start/Restart button (#617). A third trigger — an
unattended daily respawn job — was retired in #616: fleet-config#442/#449
shipped compact-and-continue (chief hands its own handover log back to itself
on every session start), so a schedule that force-restarted chief unattended
would now discard a live batch's context instead of protecting it. ``fresh=1``
(a graceful stop-then-respawn) is kept as an explicit operator action only,
still used by the manual Restart button — nothing calls it unattended anymore.

    ``ensure_chief`` is spawn-if-absent, but it is not the only way a chief
    gets started. Two ways it slips past the label: Roberto opens a plain
    Coding-tab session in fleet-config and types ``/chief`` himself, or — the
    case actually observed live, verified against the real session
    (1c8e6dde…) rather than only synthetic tests — the session-host restarts,
    killing the PTY, and he re-attaches the *same underlying Claude Code
    conversation* via Resume. Either way the launcher never gets to pass
    ``label="chief"`` at spawn, so every consumer keying on it — this
    module's own ``_find_chief``, ``chief_ops.py``'s worker-cap count and
    ``chief-sid`` lookup (both read straight off ``GET /api/board``, so this
    reconciliation is the only place any of them needs fixing), the Board's
    crown/tint — silently treats a live, working chief as not running.

    Three independent, narrow signals, any one sufficient on its own — not a
    stack of guesses, three genuinely different things a chief session does,
    each read from wherever Claude Code's own self-declared identity surfaces
    earliest:

    * ``live_title`` (#628, :func:`_live_title_names_chief`): checked first
      here because it is available earliest — Claude Code re-emits its own
      established OSC title on a Resume, before any hook fires or the user
      types anything, closing the exact gap #628 was filed over (a resumed
      chief unidentifiable "until its first hook fires").
    * ``prompt_title`` (#266): the session-host's own capture of the first
      line ever *submitted* into this PTY. Exact for a freshly typed
      ``/chief`` — but a Resume never re-submits it (the conversation is
      already past that point), so this alone misses exactly the observed
      case.
    * ``shared_name`` (fleet-config#302): Claude Code's own self-derived name
      for the *conversation*, not the PTY — read from its live per-process
      registry via the hook state file, joined by the same agent-aware claim
      walk every other cross-tab title uses (:func:`board.attach_shared_names`).
      This persists across a Resume into a brand-new PTY, because it belongs
      to the conversation, not the process that's currently attached to it —
      but it needs a hook to have fired at least once, which is exactly the
      window ``live_title`` above closes.

    All three are scoped to a live PTY cwd'd in the fleet-config checkout — a
    directory name alone proves nothing (the dead ``name == "chief"``
    fallback below learned that the hard way: it reads the *launcher's*
    session name, which is the project name ("fleet-config") for a
    Resume-launched session, never "chief").

    nothing qualifies — same degradation contract every other
    ``board_state`` reader already follows; the caller treats that as "fall
    back to a fresh spawn", not an error.

    **Newest is not the same as right (#670).** The original lookup ranked
    candidates on ``updated_at`` alone, which inverts after any event that
    kills the chief's PTY: the real conversation's row freezes at the moment
    of death, while the blank chief spawned seconds later by the fallback
    path — renamed ``"chief"`` by ``ensure_chief`` itself, so indistinguishable
    by name — keeps writing rows and always wins the recency race. Resume
    then reattached a conversation whose entire content was ``/chief`` and
    the handover file, and it ratcheted: with #640's stop-the-live-chief-first
    ordering, the live blank chief won every subsequent press too, so no
    amount of pressing Resume could get back to the real conversation
    (observed live 2026-07-28: a 95-line, 10-minute-old conversation resumed
    over a 6 468-line one that had been running for three days).

    So substance decides, not just recency. Candidates are ranked in tiers,
    newest-first within each:

    1. ``preferred_sid`` — the conversation of the live chief this resume is
       about to stop, when it has substance. Honors #640's context-preserving
       restart *and* covers a chief the launcher never spawned (its row is
       named after the project, never ``"chief"``, so the name scan below
       cannot see it at all).
    2. Rows named ``"chief"`` (case-insensitive, mirroring ``_CHIEF_TITLE``)
       with a **confirmed** typed human prompt.
    3. The same rows with *unknown* substance — an unreadable transcript, or
       one too big for the tail window to answer over. Unknown is not a
       negative (:func:`board.has_typed_user_prompt`); it just ranks below a
       confirmed one, so a long autonomous chief is still resumable when
       nothing better exists.

    A row whose transcript is *confirmed* to hold no typed prompt is never
    resumed at any tier — reattaching it is worth strictly less than the
    fresh spawn the caller falls back to, which at least re-runs ``/chief``.

    **The durable pointer (#675).** Tiers 2 and 3 above can only ever see what
    ``sessions-state.json`` still holds, and two perfectly resumable chiefs are
    invisible to it: one the launcher never spawned (its row is named after the
    project, so the name scan skips it) once its PTY is gone, and any chief
    dead longer than the hook writer's 24h prune (no row left at all). So the
    remembered conversation (:mod:`src.chief_pointer`, written by
    :func:`_note_chief_conversation` while the chief was alive) joins the scan
    as one more candidate — exempt from the name check and the row-freshness
    gate, since bypassing exactly those two is its purpose, but subject to
    every other rule. It is deliberately **not** a tier of its own: above the
    scan it would override a better live answer, and below it an older
    launcher-spawned row would outrank the newer conversation the pointer
    names. Ranked by its row's ``updated_at`` when that row still exists
    (a live conversation's true recency) and by the pointer's own ``seen_at``
    when it doesn't.

    truthy → reattach the chief conversation worth continuing instead of
    starting fresh (#633): stops any live chief first (same as ``fresh`` —
    never end up with two), looks up the newest *substantive* same-day chief
    conversation in ``sessions-state.json`` for the fleet-config checkout —
    preferring the one the just-stopped PTY was attached to, and never a

    ``claude --resume <id>`` (never the bare interactive picker), skipping the

    a bootstrap-only one, in which case the substantive conversation it
    displaced wins instead (#670: that is exactly the case where resuming
    "itself" is what loses the real chief). The lookup also consults the

    dead past the 24h row-prune, is still reachable. No resumable id (state
    pruned past the 24h window, no prior chief, or nothing but bootstrap-only
    conversations) degrades to today's fresh-spawn-
    and-``/chief`` path, never a hard failure — the response's ``resumed`` /
    ``resume_fallback_reason`` fields tell the caller which happened.
