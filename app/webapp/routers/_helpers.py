    The default is to mirror; only a caller that explicitly says it will

      of its own, so mirror to one.
    * **Desktop browser** — ``desktop: true`` in the launch body (issue
      #241): mirror to a dedicated, independently-closable Edge window rather
      than rendering the terminal inside the user's own browser. This
      reverses issue #159's desktop-skips-mirror optimization for the PTY
      case — the "redundant" in-page render was the very thing that let Stop
      & Close tear down the controlling Chrome window, so the dedicated
      window is the fix, not the redundancy. The flag (set client-side by
      ``isDesktopClient``) is what distinguishes a desktop from a phone
      regardless of loopback vs tunnel.
    * **Genuine in-page loopback browser** — ``in_page: true`` in the launch
      body (issue #609): the SPA itself sets this whenever it's about to
      render the session in-page (``applyLaunchSizePayload``'s non-desktop
      branch — a phone always takes this branch too, but the non-loopback
      check above already mirrors it before this is ever consulted). An
      *explicit* signal, not an inference from "loopback and no desktop
      flag" — that inference used to double as "skip", which silently
      starved every non-browser loopback API caller (a script, an
      orchestrator dispatching over ``127.0.0.1``) of a window at all:
      there was no page for them to render into, so "skip" meant "renders
