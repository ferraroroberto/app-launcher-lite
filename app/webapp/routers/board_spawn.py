"""Shared spawn-then-type mechanics for the Board tab's launch paths.

Split off ``app/webapp/routers/board.py`` (issue #691, a `/codebase-audit`
maintainability finding), the same way ``jobs_run.py`` was split off
``jobs.py``. This module owns the parts of the Board's launch path that are
reused across *both* route modules:

* :func:`_safe_list_sessions` — the degradation-safe live-session read.
* :func:`_resolve_repo_entry` — bare repo name → live projects-folder entry.
* :func:`_agent_and_flags` — the Board's per-launch model selector (#500/#505).
* :func:`_await_dispatch_ready` / :func:`_await_pty_quiescent` /
  :func:`_type_into_session` — the readiness, quiescence and framing rules for
  writing text into a freshly spawned PTY (#64/#166/#245/#302/#549/#611).

Kept as its own module: ``board.py`` (columns, drill-down, issue-start,
dispatch) routes through this machinery.

The timing constants are module-level so tests can patch them tiny; patch them
**here**, not on the route modules that call through.
