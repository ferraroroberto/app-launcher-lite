"""``run-job`` subcommand — the sole executor for the Jobs tab.

Every Jobs-tab trigger funnels through this one entry point:

* Windows Task Scheduler fires ``pythonw launcher.py run-job <id>``
  (scheduled runs).
* The webapp's ``POST /api/jobs/<id>/run`` spawns the same command
  detached (manual / Stream Deck / phone tap).

Both paths produce identical run records under ``webapp/jobs/<id>/<rid>/``
— ``run.json`` (metadata) plus ``output.log`` (combined stdout+stderr).

Target dispatch (issue #70) goes through the job-kind registry in
:mod:`src.jobs_kinds` — one module per kind (``python``, ``batch``,
``powershell``, ``shell-wsl``, ``inline-shell``, ``http-check``), each
contributing a ``build_argv()``. ``build_invocation`` here just resolves
which kind a job is (:func:`src.jobs_kinds.resolve_kind`) and delegates;
see that package's docstring for the dispatch shape each kind produces.

``args`` is split on whitespace before being appended to argv. Jobs that
need arguments containing spaces should put the argument inside the
script/wrapper itself rather than relying on shell quoting.

Every spawned run is guarded by :class:`_RunWatchdog` (issue #695), the
last-resort backstop that kills a wedged tree and finalises the record
``failed`` no matter *why* it wedged — because every safety net further
downstream shares fate with the thing it is guarding.

    Every *inner* safety net in a job's stack shares fate with the thing
    it guards — the visible-job console tee, ``claude_progress``'s own
    stall watchdog several layers downstream, whatever a future job kind
    adds. On 2026-07-30 a run froze on a console-backpressure deadlock
    and sat ``running`` for five hours because the inner watchdog that
    should have caught it deadlocked on the same jammed pipe chain.

    The executor is the one layer whose health depends on nothing the
    child does: it needs only to keep a thread ticking and be able to
    call :func:`~src.diagnostics.kill_process_tree`. So this watchdog
    assumes nothing about *why* a run is stuck, and watches two signals
    that need no cooperation from anything downstream:

    * **no output growth** — ``output.log`` hasn't gained a byte in
      ``no_output_seconds``;
    * **total runtime** — wall-clock since spawn exceeds
      ``max_runtime_seconds``.

    Either breach kills the child's whole process tree. That also
    unwedges the main thread for free: the child's pipe closes, the tee
    loop hits EOF, ``proc.wait()`` returns, and ``execute()``'s normal
    finalisation runs — so this class never finalises a run itself, it
    only records *why* it fired for the caller to stamp.

    Both ceilings are resolved on the **main** thread before the thread
    starts (see :func:`_resolve_watchdog_limits`); ``None`` disables that
    signal. Inside the loop nothing is touched but ``Path.stat``,
    ``Popen.poll``, and a bounded ``Event.wait`` — no config load, no
    notifier, no logging (see :func:`_log_off_thread`) — so the watchdog
