"""``run-job`` subcommand — the sole executor for the Jobs tab.

Every Jobs-tab trigger funnels through this one entry point:

* Windows Task Scheduler fires ``pythonw launcher.py run-job <id>``
  (scheduled runs).
* The webapp's ``POST /api/jobs/<id>/run`` spawns the same command
  detached (manual / Stream Deck / phone tap).

Both paths produce identical run records under ``webapp/jobs/<id>/<rid>/``
— ``run.json`` (metadata) plus ``output.log`` (combined stdout+stderr).

Target dispatch (issue #70) goes through the job-kind registry in
:mod:`src.jobs_kinds` — one module per kind (``python``, ``batch``,
``powershell``, ``shell-wsl``, ``inline-shell``, ``http-check``), each
contributing a ``build_argv()``. ``build_invocation`` here just resolves
which kind a job is (:func:`src.jobs_kinds.resolve_kind`) and delegates;
see that package's docstring for the dispatch shape each kind produces.

``args`` is split on whitespace before being appended to argv. Jobs that
need arguments containing spaces should put the argument inside the
script/wrapper itself rather than relying on shell quoting.

Everything that supervises a *live* child lives in
:mod:`src.run_supervision` (issue #14): the ``visible``-job console tee,
the resource sampler, and the last-resort
:class:`~src.run_supervision.RunWatchdog` (issue #695) that kills a
wedged tree and lets this module finalise the record ``failed`` no matter
*why* it wedged. What stays here is the executor proper —
invocation-building, admission control (cooldown, mutex), finalisation,
chain dispatch, and the CLI entry point.
