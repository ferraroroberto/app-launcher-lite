"""Loopback-only HTTP + WebSocket surface for launcher-owned PTY sessions.

Binds ``127.0.0.1`` exclusively — it is **never** directly reachable from
the network. The main webapp (which owns all auth, Tailscale gating, and
WebAuthn) proxies to it. Keeping the PTYs in this separate long-lived
process means a webapp restart doesn't kill running agent sessions.

Routes:

    POST   /sessions                  → spawn a registered terminal command
    GET    /sessions                  → list live sessions
    GET    /sessions/{sid}            → one session's detail
    POST   /sessions/{sid}/input      → write text to the PTY
    POST   /sessions/{sid}/resize     → resize the PTY
    POST   /sessions/{sid}/stop       → interrupt | quit | kill
    POST   /sessions/{sid}/rename     → set/clear a manual title override
    POST   /sessions/{sid}/image      → save an uploaded image, type its path
    WS     /sessions/{sid}/ws?role=   → scrollback snapshot + live duplex stream

Only ``kind=pty`` sessions have a WebSocket. ``role`` (``pc`` | ``phone``,
default ``phone``) marks who the client is: ``resize`` frames are honoured
only from the phone, so the phone and the PC mirror window never fight
over the single PTY's dimensions.

WebSocket protocol — server→client frames are raw terminal output;
client→server frames are JSON: ``{"type":"input","data":"…"}`` or
``{"type":"resize","rows":N,"cols":N}``.

Run standalone: ``python -m app.session_host.server`` (or the
``session-host`` CLI subcommand).
