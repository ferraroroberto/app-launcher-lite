# The launcher-owned PTY terminal

The architecture, security model, and hard-won gotchas behind the launcher-owned ConPTY terminal — a full interactive terminal on the phone, and why each piece is shaped the way it is. Read this before extending the terminal feature.

## 1. What we set out to do

Replace the fire-and-forget "detached CMD window the launcher can't see" model with **launcher-owned ConPTY sessions**, and put a **full interactive terminal on the phone** on top — live output, scrollback, typing, `Ctrl+C`, `/quit`, image paste. Non-negotiable: it had to be at least as safe as the existing cloud surface, ideally safer.

## 2. The architecture, and why each piece exists

- **A separate `session-host` process owns the PTYs.** The obvious design is "the webapp owns the ConPTYs." It's wrong: every *Restart webapp* would kill every running agent session. Pulling the PTYs into their own long-lived process (loopback-only, port `8446`, owned by the tray like `cloudflared`) means the streaming layer can restart without touching the work. **Lesson: separate the thing that restarts often from the thing that must not die.**
- **The webapp is the single auth choke point.** WebSockets *bypass HTTP middleware* — the bearer-token middleware never runs for a `ws://` upgrade. So every WS route re-applies the full gate (Tailscale check, bearer, passkey token) by hand. **Lesson: if you add an auth middleware, audit every protocol that skips it.**
- **The session-host fans output to N subscribers.** Making it multi-subscriber from day one (ring buffer + per-client queues) is what later made the PC mirror window a 10-line change instead of a rewrite.

## 3. Security: the model and the reasoning

The user's own framing was the key insight: *"the risk is the same risk I already have — anyone on my tailnet could already RDP in."* That's true, and it's why **Tailscale-only** is the foundation, not an afterthought. But "no worse than today" isn't the bar for a surface that runs `--dangerously-skip-permissions` — so we layered:

1. **Tailscale-only** — reject the `Cf-Ray` / `Cf-Connecting-IP` headers (public Cloudflare tunnel) and require the client IP in the `100.64.0.0/10` CGNAT range, loopback, or an explicit allowlist.
2. **Bearer token** — same as the rest of the app.
3. **WebAuthn platform passkey (Face ID)** — an enrolled-device whitelist. A passkey assertion mints a short-lived (12 h) terminal token; the WS and image endpoints demand it.
4. **Audit log** — every session start/stop, WS open/close, input, image, plus a full per-session transcript.

**Lesson: defense in depth means each layer assumes the others failed.** The passkey gate is worthless if the attacker is already on the tailnet *and* has the bearer token — but it's not *meant* to stop that; it's meant to stop the case where they have the token but not your phone.

**The deliberate exception:** loopback clients (the PC itself) skip the passkey — the iPhone's passkey isn't on the PC anyway, and loopback already implies you're at the machine. Scoped, documented, intentional. **Lesson: a bypass is fine if it's narrower than the thing it bypasses and you wrote down why.**

## 4. Gotchas, and what each one taught us

### A correct security boundary that *looked* like a bug

The phone showed a bare "Disconnected." The terminal was Tailscale-only and the phone was on the **public Cloudflare tunnel** — the gate worked *perfectly*. But the WS closed *before* `accept()`, so the browser only saw close code `1006` with no reason. **Two lessons:**

- **Accept the WebSocket first, then close with a code + reason.** Closing before the handshake completes gives the client nothing to display.
- **A correct rejection still needs a good error.** We added `/api/status` → `terminal.reachable/reason` and a pre-flight check so the UI explains *"open me over the Tailscale URL"* instead of failing mute. Security that the user experiences as a random bug erodes trust in the security.

### "It works when I run it, but not from the tray"

The tray's Tailscale-URL lookup failed only when launched by the tray. Root cause chain: (1) the venv `pythonw.exe` is a **redirector stub** — every launch is one idle stub + one real process; (2) the real cause was the `tailscale` CLI **not being on `PATH`** (it lives in `C:\Program Files\Tailscale\`); (3) a 4 s subprocess timeout was too short under tray-startup load. **Lessons: never assume a CLI is on `PATH`** (probe Program Files), **give startup-path subprocesses generous timeouts**, and **when a process behaves differently by launcher, suspect the environment, not the code.** We also made it write a debug log and surface the failure reason in the notification — diagnosing this blind cost hours.

### One PTY has exactly one size

When the phone and the PC mirror both attach to the same ConPTY, they **cannot** each have their own layout — a pseudo-console has a single `rows × cols`. The last client to call `resize()` wins, so they fight. There is no clever fix; you **pick an authority**. We made the phone the sole size authority (the WS proxy tags each client `role=pc|phone`; the session-host honours `resize` only from `phone`) and the PC window *mirrors* whatever size the phone set. **Lesson: when a resource is fundamentally single-valued, don't simulate sharing — assign ownership.**

### Detached ≠ untracked

The original "remote" launch orphaned a CMD window the launcher kept no handle to. Re-adding it as a *mode*, we kept a kill switch *without* holding a child handle: the console is spawned through a transient PowerShell `Start-Process -PassThru` that **re-parents it out of the session-host's process tree** — so a `tray.bat --restart`, which tears the tray subtree down with `taskkill /T`, can't cascade into it (issue #130) — and the launcher keeps **only the PID** that `-PassThru` printed. That PID is enough to **list and kill** it (`taskkill /PID … /T /F`); liveness is a bare PID probe, not a `Popen`. **Lesson: "detached" and "untracked" are different choices — you can have the window's independence (it even survives a launcher restart) and still keep a kill switch.**

### Self-signed certs and loopback

The PC mirror window (an Edge/Chrome `--app` window over `https://127.0.0.1`) tripped the cert error: the cert's SAN is the `.ts.net` hostname, not `127.0.0.1`, and the CA isn't trusted on the PC. Fix: `--ignore-certificate-errors --test-type`, **safe specifically because that window only ever points at our own loopback origin**. **Lesson: "ignore cert errors" is a scoped tool, not a sin — the question is always *which* origin.**

## 5. Practices that held up

- **Plan mode first, sharp questions before code.** The two `AskUserQuestion` rounds (terminal reachability scope, device-binding method, sizing authority) each prevented a rewrite. One good question beats a day of rework.
- **Phased execution with verification gates.** Backend (5 files) → `py_compile` + import smoke test → frontend (4 files) → `node --check` + boot check. Each phase provably green before the next.
- **Cheap gates, every time.** `py_compile`, `node --check`, an import-and-`create_app()` smoke test, `curl /healthz`. None take more than seconds; together they catch most "it doesn't even start" bugs.
- **Cache-busting is automatic.** Static asset URLs carry a content hash (`?v=<hash>`) stamped at serve time, so any edit busts the phone's cache with no manual step — see `docs/cache-hygiene-asset-hashing.md` (and do **not** reintroduce hand-bumped `?v=N` query strings). Mobile Safari caches aggressively, so "the user is testing stale code" used to be a costly confusion; the content hash removes it.
- **The reference doc lives next to the code.** `docs/` captures durable design rationale; updating it in the same change as the code keeps it honest.
- **Diagnose from the audit log.** The "Disconnected" bug was solved by reading the client IP out of the audit log — `188.x` = public tunnel. The logging we built for security paid for itself as debugging.

## 6. If you extend this

- **Per-client rendering** would need the session-host to broadcast size-change frames so a mirror can letterbox/scale instead of just matching. We chose not to — "phone drives, PC mirrors" was enough.
- **Detached sessions now survive a `tray.bat --restart`** (issue #130). The console is re-parented out of the tray's process tree and the session-host (`:8446`) is excluded from the restart's reclaim sweep, so the fresh tray re-adopts the still-running session-host and its in-memory list — the detached window keeps running and stays listed (`alive` is a PID probe). The gap left: a genuine *session-host process* restart still drops them from the list — the orphaned console keeps running but its PID is no longer tracked. Re-discovery by process scan would close that gap; it wasn't worth the complexity.
- **The terminal token TTL is 12 h.** If you shorten it, add a quiet re-auth path so the user isn't bounced mid-session.
- **Edit mode** gates per-row rename/remove behind a Settings toggle to keep the lists icon-free. If you add more per-row actions, put them there too — resist icon inflation.
