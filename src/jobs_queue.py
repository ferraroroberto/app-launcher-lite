"""Cross-job mutex queue for the Jobs tab (issue #68 PR #2).

When a job carries a ``mutex_group`` and another job in the same group is
``running`` or ``pending``, the fresh fire is queued rather than rejected.
The finalising executor pops the next entry on its way out and spawns it
detached. Queue file lives at :data:`JOBS_QUEUE_PATH` (one JSON document,
keyed by group → FIFO list of pending entries).

Split out of :mod:`src.jobs` (issue #315) — run-history file storage lives
in :mod:`src.jobs_history`, schtasks sync + spawn helpers in
:mod:`src.jobs_schtasks`, and percentiles/health in :mod:`src.jobs_stats`.
