"""App-launcher's own boot-at-log-on toggle (issue #456, part 1/2).

The README's manual recipe (`Auto-start at log on with Task Scheduler`)
creates an "At log on" scheduled task pointing at ``tray.bat``. Reproducing
that programmatically from the webapp process was tried and reverted:
``schtasks /Create /SC ONLOGON`` returns "Access is denied" from an
unelevated process (empirically verified) — Windows gates the ONLOGON/
ONSTART trigger types behind elevation, unlike the Jobs tab's time-based
schedules (``DAILY``/``HOURLY``/…) which `src.jobs_schtasks` creates fine
from this same unprivileged process.

Instead this drops a tiny wrapper ``.bat`` into the current user's own
Startup folder (``%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\
Startup``) — a plain file write under the user's own profile, no
elevation needed, and the standard no-admin mechanism Windows itself
offers for per-user login autostart (other installed apps, e.g. Telegram,
already use it on this machine).

Diagnosability (issue #582): a login-time launch that dies silently is
un-debuggable, so the wrapper is not a bare ``call tray.bat`` — it writes
a timestamped breadcrumb, redirects ``tray.bat``'s own output, and logs
its exit code to ``webapp\\startup.log`` (gitignored via ``*.log``) on
every login attempt, so a future failure is diagnosable from that log
alone. It also checks the one hard precondition that makes ``tray.bat``
``exit /b 1`` — the repo-local ``scripts\\tray_lifecycle.ps1`` helper being
absent (a broken checkout, not something a retry could fix) — and records it.
No network/Tailscale dependency exists on this path: the Startup wrapper
calls ``tray.bat`` *without* ``--restart``, and the lifecycle helper's
plain-``launch`` action only detects local processes and starts a local
pythonw — it performs git/HTTP verification solely under ``-Restart`` —
so late Tailscale cannot make the login launch fail, and no retry loop is
warranted (the breadcrumb is what would justify one later, with evidence).
