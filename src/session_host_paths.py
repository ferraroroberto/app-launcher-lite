"""Declared session-host paths + touched-path diff, for `/api/version`'s
staleness scoping (#635).

`_session_host_freshness()` in `app/webapp/routers/misc.py` used to flag the
session-host `stale` the instant its loaded `git_sha` differed from the
repo's current `HEAD` — true after *any* merge anywhere in the repo, not just
one that touched code the session-host actually loads. This module supplies
the missing scope: which paths the session-host declares
(`CLAUDE.md`'s `## session-host` block, project-scaffolding's deploy-coverage
convention, `#629`) and whether the diff between two shas touched any of them.

Hand-rolled rather than importing `fleet-config`'s
`skills/_lib/deploy_coverage.py` (which does the equivalent parse/intersect
for the `/issue-finish` skill) — fleet-config is a sibling checkout, not a
Python dependency of this repo, and this module only ever needs one fixed
section (`## session-host`), not deploy_coverage's general multi-component
parser.
