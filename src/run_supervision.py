"""Supervision machinery for a spawned job run — console tee, resource
sampler, last-resort watchdog.

Extracted from :mod:`app.cli.commands.run_job_cmd` (issue #14), which now
owns only invocation-building and the ``run-job`` CLI entry point. The
three primitives here share one property that makes them a clean seam:
each one is handed a live child (``pid`` / ``Popen``) plus, at most, the
path of that run's ``output.log``, and touches none of the executor's
other state — no registry, no run record, no chain/mutex bookkeeping.

* :func:`tee_pipe_to_file_and_console` — the ``visible``-job output tee
  (issue #694): ``output.log`` is the record, the console is lossy live
  display.
* :class:`ResourceSampler` — peak RSS + accumulated CPU across the child's
  process tree, best-effort.
* :class:`RunWatchdog` + :func:`resolve_watchdog_limits` — the last-resort
  backstop that kills a wedged tree (issue #695).

Everything here is best-effort by design: a failure inside supervision
must never take down the run it is supervising, so ``psutil`` errors are
swallowed, a broken console stops being written to, and the watchdog
records *why* it fired rather than finalising the run itself.

    Every *inner* safety net in a job's stack shares fate with the thing
    it guards — the visible-job console tee, ``claude_progress``'s own
    stall watchdog several layers downstream, whatever a future job kind
    adds. On 2026-07-30 a run froze on a console-backpressure deadlock
    and sat ``running`` for five hours because the inner watchdog that
    should have caught it deadlocked on the same jammed pipe chain.

    The executor is the one layer whose health depends on nothing the
    child does: it needs only to keep a thread ticking and be able to
    call :func:`~src.diagnostics.kill_process_tree`. So this watchdog
    assumes nothing about *why* a run is stuck, and watches two signals
    that need no cooperation from anything downstream:

    * **no output growth** — ``output.log`` hasn't gained a byte in
      ``no_output_seconds``;
    * **total runtime** — wall-clock since spawn exceeds
      ``max_runtime_seconds``.

    Either breach kills the child's whole process tree. That also
    unwedges the main thread for free: the child's pipe closes, the tee
    loop hits EOF, ``proc.wait()`` returns, and the executor's normal
    finalisation runs — so this class never finalises a run itself, it
    only records *why* it fired for the caller to stamp.

    Both ceilings are resolved on the **main** thread before the thread
    starts (see :func:`resolve_watchdog_limits`); ``None`` disables that
    signal. Inside the loop nothing is touched but ``Path.stat``,
    ``Popen.poll``, and a bounded ``Event.wait`` — no config load, no
    notifier, no logging (see :func:`_log_off_thread`) — so the watchdog
