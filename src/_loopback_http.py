"""Shared plumbing for the loopback sibling-app HTTP clients.

Clients like ``session_client`` talk to a
same-host sibling app over loopback and make the *same* three decisions on
every call: a transport failure (``requests.RequestException``) maps to a 503,
a ``>= 400`` upstream response surfaces with its own status (preferring the
body's ``detail``), and a non-JSON body either collapses to ``{}`` or raises.
This module owns that decision once, plus the per-call
``InsecureRequestWarning`` suppression every ``verify=False`` loopback call
would otherwise emit — so each per-service client shrinks to a list of
endpoint signatures delegating here.

Each client declares a trivial :class:`LoopbackError` subclass (e.g.
``SessionHostError``) so callers keep catching one service's failures
without catching another's; the shared ``status``-carrying ``__init__`` lives
on the base.

Every call also shares one pooled, keep-alive :data:`SESSION` (issue #605) —
a bare ``requests.get``/``requests.request`` opens a fresh TCP connection per
call, and each closed connection parks its ephemeral port in ``TIME_WAIT`` for
~120 s on Windows. The Board and Coding tabs poll the session-host
continuously, so that was measured holding 145 such sockets to ``:8466`` at a
single sample. ``SESSION`` is built once at import and never reconfigured per
call — ``requests.Session`` is not thread-safe for *configuration* mutation,
but plain request dispatch on a shared ``HTTPAdapter`` pool is fine across the
several ``asyncio.to_thread`` worker threads that share it concurrently.
