"""Assembly logic for the Board tab's kanban columns (issue #300 / #164).

Five single-purpose columns (#399): Backlog and Done hold issues only;
Claude's turn and Your turn hold session cards only; Other holds everything
else that needs attention but isn't a terminal or an issue — open PRs and
failed/stuck jobs. See :func:`build_board` for the exact routing.

Three inputs, one board:

* the **live session list** from the session-host (``session_client.list_sessions``),
* the **sessions-state file** written by the ``session_state`` hook
  (``~/.copilot/hooks/state/sessions-state.json`` — ``working`` / ``needs-you``
  / ``idle`` rows per recent coding session),
* the **jobs attention scan** (failed-today / stuck runs from ``src.jobs``),

plus the in-memory GitHub snapshot from :mod:`src.github_client`.

This module is now a thin ``build_board`` assembly plus the jobs-attention
scan (issue #408 split — was a 690-line god file). The three other concerns
each own their own module, and their public names are re-exported here so
every existing ``board.<name>`` call site (routers, tests) keeps working
unchanged:

* :mod:`src.board_state` — hook-state-file IO (:func:`read_sessions_state`,
  :func:`read_active_issues`).
* :mod:`src.board_sessions` — session-claim/merge logic
  (:func:`merge_sessions`, :func:`attach_shared_names`,
  :func:`state_row_for_session`). Writer-provided launcher id + agent wins;
  agent-less rows use an agent-gated normalized-cwd fallback.
* :mod:`src.board_transcript` — transcript-JSONL parsing
  (:func:`last_exchange`, plus the activity-overlay/external-liveness helpers
  ``merge_sessions`` calls internally).

Degradation contract (#164 acceptance): a missing/corrupt/stale state file
must never error — session cards fall back to ``unknown`` status and the
GitHub/jobs columns render regardless.

Shared session title (#396): the state row also carries ``name``/``name_source``
(the agent's live session title, where one exists). ``merge_sessions`` copies
those onto every card as ``shared_name``/``shared_name_source``, and
:func:`attach_shared_names` runs the identical agent-aware claim walk for the
Coding tab's own ``/api/coding/sessions`` list — so a live session
resolves to the same state row, and therefore the same title, on both tabs.
The frontend's precedence lives in one place, ``sessions.js``'s
``sessionTitle()``, which both tabs call.
