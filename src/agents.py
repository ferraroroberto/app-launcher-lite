"""Terminal-agent registries for Coding launches and loopback PTY clients.

The Coding tab launches one of several interactive terminal agents in
a project folder, all hosted by the same session-host PTY/remote
machinery:

- ``claude`` — Claude Code (the launcher's original agent).
- ``codex`` — OpenAI's Codex CLI (the Rust terminal agent; runs on the
  user's ChatGPT-plan login, not API-key billing).
- ``agy`` — Google's Antigravity CLI (the Go-based terminal agent that
  replaced Gemini CLI).
- ``copilot`` — GitHub Copilot CLI (GitHub's terminal-native agentic
  coding agent; authenticates in-session via ``/login``).
- ``pi`` — the Pi coding agent, launched under the ``claude-agent-sdk``
  provider so it runs on the Claude subscription (no API credits); see
  ``build_pi_flags`` and ``docs/pi-coding-agent.md``.
- ``grok`` — xAI's Grok Build CLI (the Rust terminal agent; browser
  OAuth or ``XAI_API_KEY``, both out-of-band like every other agent).

This module is the single source of truth for the agent id → command
mapping. ``AGENTS`` contains the coding agents exposed by the webapp;
``SESSION_HOST_AGENTS`` adds loopback-only PTY commands such as SSH. The
split keeps service integrations out of the Coding tab while letting the
session-host reuse its normal ConPTY/WebSocket machinery for them.

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Agent:
    """One command that the terminal session-host can launch.

    ``id`` is the stable key threaded through the launch API; ``label``
    is the display name; ``command`` is the executable resolved off
    ``PATH`` when the agent is spawned; ``quit_command`` is the
    interactive command typed into the PTY for a graceful stop (each
    program uses its own — Claude's is ``/quit``; Copilot's and SSH's are
    ``/exit`` and ``exit`` respectively).

    ``fullscreen`` marks a full-screen *differential* TUI (Codex's
    ratatui, and the other terminal agents) that repaints in place rather
    than scrolling inline like Claude Code. The session-host streams these
    differently: it must **not** replay the raw scrollback ring on
    (re)connect — doing so dumps stale move-cursor/clear deltas into a
    fresh xterm and re-answers the agent's startup terminal queries (the
    ``[?1;2c`` DA leak, issue #128) — and instead forces a clean repaint.

    ``resume_token`` is the agent's *native* resume invocation, spliced
    between the command and the flags for a Resume launch (issue #151) so
    the agent renders its own session picker over the PTY — the launcher
    never builds a session list of its own. It is a flag for the
    flag-shaped agents (Claude/Copilot ``--resume``) and a subcommand for
    Codex (``resume``). Antigravity has no picker flag, so it maps to
    ``--continue`` (reopen the most recent conversation — the closest
    native behaviour). Empty means the agent has no resume path.

    ``native_name_flag`` is a spawn-time flag that gives a new session a
    picker-visible title. It is intentionally separate from a live rename:
    the launcher must never type into a running agent TUI (#555). Empty means
    the agent exposes no verified non-PTY naming mechanism.
