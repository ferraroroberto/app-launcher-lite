"""Launcher-owned PTY sessions — the foundation for the phone terminal.

A :class:`PtySession` wraps a ``winpty.PtyProcess`` running the selected
coding agent (see :mod:`src.agents`) inside a ConPTY the launcher owns.
A background reader thread pumps the session's terminal output into a
bounded ring buffer (so a reconnecting client gets scrollback) and to
every live subscriber queue. :class:`SessionManager` owns the set of
live sessions.

This module has no web-framework imports — ``app/session_host/server.py``
is the HTTP + WebSocket surface layered on top of it. It is Windows-only
(ConPTY); the ``winpty`` import is guarded so the module still imports for
``py_compile`` on other platforms.

# colour payload — so we never touch title OSC (0/1/2), hyperlink OSC 8,
# clipboard OSC 52, or any CSI.

# Terminator handling differs by form (empirical, from a live pywinpty
# capture of Codex startup): the ``rgb:``/``#`` *reply* always carries a BEL

# Codex **unterminated and back-to-back** — ``ESC]10;?ESC]11;?`` — each query
# implicitly ended by the next ESC, with no BEL/ST at all. The original #270
# pattern required a terminator on every form, so it silently MISSED these
# bare queries: they reached xterm.js, which answered with ``ESC]10;rgb:…``,
# and that reply leaked. So the terminator is OPTIONAL for the ``?`` query
# (a bare ``ESC]1X;?`` is already a complete colour query) and stays REQUIRED

        ``framePaste``/``sendSubmit``/``bulkSettle`` (issues #166/#450/#499)
        for the HTTP ``/input`` path (issue #611), which previously wrote the
        (unconditionally bracketed) text and the CR back-to-back with no
        settle logic — Claude Code's composer classifies a bulk write as a
        paste, and a CR arriving mid-ingest is absorbed as a literal newline
        instead of Submit, stranding the message as an unsent
        ``[Pasted text #N]`` chip while the caller was told ``ok: true``.

        - Bracketed-paste framing (``\\x1b[200~ … \\x1b[201~``) is applied
          only when ``self._bracketed_paste_mode`` is currently on (tracked
          from the PTY's own DECSET 2004 output — see
          ``_scan_bracketed_paste_mode``), matching ``framePaste``'s gate on
          xterm's client-side ``term.modes.bracketedPasteMode`` exactly: a
          literal ``\\x1b[200~`` sent to an agent that never asked for it is
          garbage, not a paste.
        - The CR is always its own separate ``write()`` call, never
          concatenated onto the framed text (#166).
        - ``data`` blank + ``submit`` → a bare submit against whatever is
          already sitting in the composer, with no text write at all — the
          escape hatch for a message already stranded by this exact race
          (previously both ``{"data": "", "submit": true}`` and any other
          blank-data call 400'd, leaving no recovery but a human tapping the
          phone's own Send control).
        - Payloads at/above ``_BULK_SUBMIT_THRESHOLD_CHARS`` hold the CR
          until the session's output stream shows the paste was echoed and
          has gone quiet (floor/quiet/cap — #499); shorter payloads submit
          immediately, matching ``sendSubmit``'s "short sends stay instant".

        Returns whether everything asked for reached the PTY — ``False`` on
        the same drop conditions as :meth:`write` (matches #607's contract:

#                              so the session renders monochrome.

#                              --resume, no history for the whole session.
#
# The rest are the parent's own identity, stale the moment we inherit it.
#
# They reach us whenever the tray was (re)started from inside an agent's tool
# subprocess — an agent running `tray.bat --restart` is the usual route — since
# the whole tray → webapp → session-host chain inherits that environment and we
# then hand our own os.environ to everything we spawn. Scrubbing here makes a
# launcher-hosted session independent of *how* the host happened to be started.
#
# Deliberately NOT scrubbed: user-scope settings.json vars that are meant for
# every agent run (CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE, telemetry), and
# GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT — restoring git's interactive credential prompt could
# hang an agent's own git call on a prompt nobody is watching.
