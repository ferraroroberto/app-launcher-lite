"""Reconciliation for stranded ``running``/``pending`` job run records.

A run record is written as ``status: "running"`` before the child spawns and
only reaches a terminal status once the executor's own ``_finalize_run``
(:mod:`app.cli.commands.run_job_cmd`) runs after ``proc.wait()`` returns. If
the *executor itself* dies first — interrupt, reboot, OOM, a parent shell
killing its process tree — nothing ever finalises the record and it stays
``"running"`` forever, even though the child it was tracking is long gone.

This automates what the webapp's kill route already does by hand for that
exact case (``docs/jobs-tab.md`` "Stuck-run kill": *"If the executor has
already exited (orphan pid), the route still finalises the record — the UI
is the authoritative 'is this run done?' surface"*) — it does not invent a
new recovery story, just removes the requirement that a human notice and tap
Kill.

Every non-terminal record in the job's history is checked, not just the
latest — an older "running" record superseded by a newer run is invisible to
every *behavioural* consumer (mutex/streak/run-button all read only the
latest run), but it's still a lie if a user opens that specific historical
run's detail view, so it gets cleaned up too. ``list_runs`` already reads the
whole history on every poll for stats, so this doesn't add I/O beyond what a
poll already pays for.

Two entry points, split so a caller mid-way through an admission decision
never triggers a re-entrant mutex-queue spawn off stale information:

- :func:`finalize_dead_runs` — pid-liveness check + terminal write only.
  Used by ``src.jobs_queue.mutex_collision``, which is itself in the middle
  of deciding whether a *different* job may fire; draining the queue from
  there could spawn a sibling before the rest of that same collision sweep
  has re-checked it.
- :func:`reap_stranded_runs` — the above, plus draining the job's mutex
  queue once if anything was reaped. Safe from a pure read/refresh context
  that isn't deciding an admission itself:
  ``app/webapp/routers/jobs.py::_decorate_job`` (every ``/api/jobs`` poll).
  Mirrors
  :func:`src.app_runtime.prune_dead`'s lazy-on-read pattern rather than a
  background sweep loop.
