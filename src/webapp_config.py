"""Webapp-specific configuration loader.

Lives separately from `app_config.py` because these settings are
authored from the web UI ("Save defaults" button) and persist across
runs. The CLI also reads this file so both surfaces share one source
of truth.

Holds:
- network knobs (host, port)
- scan roots for Claude-Code projects and Apps
- the per-agent launch *settings* (model, effort, verbose, debug) for all
  registered coding agents (claude, codex, antigravity, copilot, pi, grok),
  together with the ``VALID_*`` / ``PI_MODEL_SPECS`` value sets each field
  validates against
- sibling-app loopback URLs (voice-transcriber, photo-ocr, local-llm-hub)
- Life OS tab settings
- terminal display and passkey / WebAuthn config
- Pushover failure-notification credentials
- auth secrets (bearer token + login password)

Config only — turning those settings into each agent's actual CLI argv is
launch logic, and lives in :mod:`src.launch_flags` (``build_*_flags``, split
out in issue #691). That module imports this one; never the reverse.

#     (its OAuth token lives in pi's auth.json). Verified no-API-credit:
#     `pi -p --provider openai-codex --model openai-codex/gpt-5.5` completes

#
# Each option maps to (provider, full `provider/id` model arg, display label);
# `build_pi_flags` switches `--provider`/`--model` on the chosen option.
