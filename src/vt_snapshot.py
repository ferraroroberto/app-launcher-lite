"""Headless VT100 screen mirror for full-screen (ratatui) PTY sessions.

A ratatui-based agent (Copilot; see :mod:`src.agents`)
re-emits its **entire transcript** on any winsize change (empirical probe,
issue #430: ~65 KB for a long conversation, on a same-shape resize toggle).
The session-host used to serve a (re)connecting client by toggling the PTY
width by one column and back (``_force_repaint`` in
``app/session_host/server.py``) so the agent would repaint at the current
size — but that SIGWINCH is exactly what triggers the full re-emission,
visible to every subscriber (issue #432).

:class:`VtSnapshot` avoids the SIGWINCH entirely: it parses the PTY's byte
stream through a headless ``pyte`` screen (fed from the same reader thread
that already fills the raw scrollback ring — see
:class:`src.session_host.PtySession`), so it always mirrors the *current*
frame. On a WS (re)connect the server renders that screen straight to ANSI
(SGR runs + cursor position) and sends it as the opening frame — no resize,
no agent re-emission, no reconnect flash.

``render()`` also prepends a bounded window of real scrollback (issue #435):
a plain :class:`pyte.Screen` only ever knows the current frame, so a client
reconnecting cold (no prior xterm state of its own) landed on exactly one
screen with nothing to scroll into. :class:`pyte.HistoryScreen` tracks lines
that scroll off the top in ``screen.history.top`` — rendered as ordinary
scrolling text (not absolute-positioned) so the client's own terminal
emulator accumulates it into its own scrollback the way live output would,
*before* the current frame paints over the viewport.

Thread-safety: ``feed``/``resize`` are called from the PTY reader thread;
``render`` is called from the asyncio event loop when a client subscribes.
A single lock serializes all three against pyte's mutable screen state.

# back toward the full-transcript re-emission #430/#432 exist to avoid.
# Twice undersized in practice, each time re-measured against a real live
# session rather than guessed: 500 was cleared by a single README dump
# (797 lines); 2000 was cleared TWICE by one heavy Codex exchange (a user
# question followed by tool-heavy investigation) that produced 3371 total
# lines — and because the user's own message always sits chronologically
# *before* the agent's much longer response within an exchange, FIFO
# eviction always drops the user's side first, which is exactly the
# "my question disappeared, the answer didn't" pattern reported live.
# That whole 3371-line real session still rendered to only ~216 KB — a
# reasonable one-time reconnect payload (zero-cost to the agent; pure
# server-side memory replay, no SIGWINCH). 10,000 gives ~3x headroom over
# the heaviest real sample seen so far; at the same ~65 bytes/line observed
# rate that's a worst-case ~650 KB payload, still well within what the
# existing repaint-batch concealment handles.
#
# User-configurable (issue #435 follow-up): the Settings tab exposes this
# as `terminal_history_lines` (src/webapp_config.py), threaded through
# SessionManager.create()'s `history_lines` param. This constant is only
# the fallback for a caller that doesn't pass one (e.g. a direct
# VtSnapshot(rows, cols) in a test).

        absolute cursor-position escape per row rather than relying on
        natural line wrap: a row that fills every column leaves the

        (proven empirically — see the vt_snapshot round-trip probe in
        issue #432 — a naive ``\\r\\n`` join shifted the whole frame down
        by one line). Absolute positioning sidesteps deferred-wrap
        entirely and lands the frame on the live state regardless of how
