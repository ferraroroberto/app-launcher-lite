"""In-process tracker for apps spawned by the launcher.

The Apps tab needs a "what did I launch?" list the way the Claude Code
tab has one for sessions. Claude sessions are owned by the session-host;
plain ``*.bat`` apps are not — they run in their own CMD windows. This
module keeps a small in-memory record of every bat the launcher spawned
so ``/api/apps/running`` can list them, bind each to its listening port,
and offer a per-instance Stop.

State lives in process memory only: a webapp restart forgets it. That
matches the rest of the tray's behaviour — orphaned listeners still show
in the Port listeners panel.

Not routed through the session-host: that host is for ``claude`` PTYs
only. This stays a plain module-level structure.
