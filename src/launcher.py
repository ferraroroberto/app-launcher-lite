"""Process-launch helpers — spawn ``*.bat`` files or coding-agent sessions.

Used by the FastAPI ``/api/apps/{id}/launch`` route:

- ``spawn_bat`` opens a new visible CMD window that runs the bat and
  stays open afterwards (so the user can interact when they're back at
  the PC).
- ``spawn_claude_session`` is the multi-agent session-launch helper for
  the Coding tab. It asks the loopback session-host to run whichever
  coding agent is requested (see :mod:`src.agents` for the full set).
  ``kind="pty"`` (full control) streams the session to and drives it
  from the phone inside a launcher-owned ConPTY. ``kind="remote"``
  (detached) opens a console window on the PC that the session-host only
  tracks — visible on the PC, killable from the phone, but not streamed.
- ``open_local_terminal_window`` opens the PC-side mirror window for a
  full-control session and (optionally) tracks its HWND so Stop & Close
  can dismiss it via WM_CLOSE — issue #20.

The Coding tab chooses the mode via the ``/api/apps/{id}/launch``
``mode`` parameter (``pty`` | ``remote``) and the agent via ``agent``.
