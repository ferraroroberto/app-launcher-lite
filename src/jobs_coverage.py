"""Missed-fire coverage for scheduled jobs (issue #697).

``alert_on_failure`` catches a run that *fails*; ``src.jobs_stats.is_stuck``
catches a run that never *ends*. Nothing caught a run that never **starts** —
a job whose Task Scheduler entry is missing, mangled, disabled, or was never
created simply doesn't fire, and the absence was invisible: the row kept
showing its old stats and no alert existed for "expected a run, saw none".

Two independent halves, both answered from data the Jobs tab already reads:

* **Structural** — every non-paused, scheduled job must have a matching,
  enabled ``\\AppLauncher\\<id>`` Task Scheduler entry. This is the cheap
  half that would have caught both real incidents (``config-map`` and
  ``sota-watch`` shipped launchers + "runs weekly unattended" docs with no
  registered task at all, for weeks), and it fires the moment the entry
  disappears — no waiting for the missed slot itself. Backed by
  :func:`src.jobs_schtasks.registered_task_states`, i.e. the *same* 30 s
  cached bulk ``schtasks /Query`` the "next run" column already pays for:
  one batched query per cycle, never an N+1 shell-out storm.
* **Behavioural** — expand the schedule across a recent window and check
  each expected fire against the on-disk run history.

Never-flag rules (the acceptance criterion is "no false positives across a
normal week"), all enforced in :func:`missed_fires` / :func:`coverage_for`:

* Paused jobs and ``schedule: none`` jobs are **exempt** — no state at all.
* ``minutes``/``hourly`` jobs skip the behavioural half: their cadence is too
  dense to enumerate (:data:`~src.jobs_schtasks.FREQUENT_SCHEDULE_TYPES`,
  same reason the agenda summarises them). The structural half still covers
  them, which is what actually detects a deleted entry.
* A slot only counts as missed once it is ``MISSED_FIRE_GRACE_SECONDS`` past
  — Task Scheduler starts late, and a run that started is a run that fired.
* **Any** run record near the slot counts as a fire, whatever its status —
  including ``skipped`` (a cooldown no-op *did* fire, it just declined to do
  work) and a manual run that happened to cover the slot.
* The window never reaches back past the job's ``added_at``, nor past the
  oldest retained run when history is at its :data:`MAX_RUNS_PER_JOB` cap —
  a pruned record is not evidence of a missed fire.
* A failed ``schtasks`` query yields ``unknown``, never "missing". An
  unestablished fact gets its own state and is never folded into the
  passing *or* the failing one.

Alerting reuses the exact channels the failure path uses
(:func:`app.cli.commands.run_job_cmd._maybe_notify_failure`): global Pushover
gated by ``WebappConfig.notify_on_failure``, per-job Telegram gated by
``Job.alert_on_failure``. De-duplicated through a small on-disk state file so
a standing problem pings once, not once per check cycle.
