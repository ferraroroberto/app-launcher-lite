"""Runtime diagnostics — log capture and port-owner introspection.

Two pieces, both pure data (no UI imports):

- ``RingLogHandler`` keeps the last N formatted Python logging lines in

  parsing files. Attached once to the root logger from ``cli.main``.

- ``port_owner`` answers "who is actually serving on port N?" using
