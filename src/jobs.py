"""Facade over the Jobs-tab backend (issue #315 split).

This module used to own everything itself; it now just re-exports the
public surface of four focused modules so existing callers
(``from src.jobs import X`` / ``from src import jobs as jobs_mod;
jobs_mod.X(...)``) keep working unchanged:

* :mod:`src.jobs_schtasks` — Windows Task Scheduler sync + spawn helpers,
  and the deterministic next-fire arithmetic.
* :mod:`src.jobs_history` — run-history file storage (``run.json`` /
  ``output.log`` under ``webapp/jobs/<job_id>/<run_id>/``).
* :mod:`src.jobs_queue` — the cross-job mutex queue + chain dispatch.
* :mod:`src.jobs_stats` — run-duration percentiles, health, stuck-run
  detection.
* :mod:`src.jobs_reap` — reconciles a run record stranded ``running`` by an
  executor that died before finalising it.
* :mod:`src.jobs_coverage` — missed-fire coverage: a scheduled job whose
  Task Scheduler entry vanished, or whose slot passed with no run record.

New code should generally import directly from the module that actually
owns what it needs; this facade exists for backward compatibility and as
a convenient one-stop import for call sites that touch several of the
above (e.g. the webapp's jobs router).

Tests that need to patch module-internal state (e.g. ``JOBS_RUNS_DIR``,
``_run_schtasks``, ``spawn_run_job_detached`` as the mutex queue's default
spawn callable) must monkeypatch the module that actually *owns* that
state — ``src.jobs_history``, ``src.jobs_schtasks``, or ``src.jobs_queue``
respectively — not this facade. Patching a name re-exported here only
rebinds the facade's copy of the reference; it has no effect on the
owning module's own globals, which is what the real code reads.

The single executor that ever runs a job is
:class:`~app.cli.commands.run_job_cmd.RunJobCommand`. Task Scheduler
calls it with ``pythonw launcher.py run-job <id>``; the webapp's
``POST /api/jobs/<id>/run`` route spawns the same command detached and
returns the new ``run_id`` immediately.
