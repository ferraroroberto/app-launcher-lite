"""Session-claim/merge logic for the Board tab (issue #408 split of ``board.py``).

Joins the **live session list** from the session-host
(``session_client.list_sessions``) with the hook-written state rows
(:mod:`src.board_state`) into board cards. The join is exact launcher id +
agent when a writer supplies those fields; agent-less rows fall back to an
agent-gated normalized-cwd claim. Two legacy live sessions in one directory
tie-break by most recent ``started_at``; the rest show ``unknown``.

Shared session title (#396): the state row also carries ``name``/``name_source``
(the agent's live session title, where one exists). :func:`merge_sessions`
copies those onto every card as ``shared_name``/``shared_name_source``, and
:func:`attach_shared_names` runs the identical agent-aware claim walk for the
Coding tab's own ``/api/coding/sessions`` list — so a live session
resolves to the same state row, and therefore the same title, on both tabs.

    Live sessions are walked newest-first. Exact launcher-session id + agent

    the same directory render ``unknown``. A state row with no live match only
    becomes an external card when recent transcript activity independently
    proves the process still exists — hook state alone is not liveness (#455).
    Waiting statuses are checked against transcript activity — see
    :func:`src.board_transcript._transcript_overlay` (#305) — and a hook
    ``needs-you`` is then split into ``stalled`` / ``awaiting-decision`` /
    ``idle-finished`` / ``awaiting-input`` (#608's
    :func:`src.board_transcript._refine_waiting_status`) so a caller never
    has to fetch the exchange to tell those four apart. The raw
    ``needs-you`` string itself never reaches a card's ``status`` field. The
    live session's ``last_output_at`` rides along with ``live_title`` to the
    matched-pairs call site only (#636) — a busy title with a genuinely
    stale PTY (no more raw output at all) falls through to this same
    transcript-based logic instead of being trusted blindly; unmatched rows
    have no live PTY to read a freshness stamp from, same scoping as
    ``live_title`` itself.

    ``idle-finished`` gets one more downgrade after that split (#627): a
    clean stop with nothing pending is still only an *absence* of evidence,
    not positive proof the session's own work is done — a turn can end mid
    task (no tool call issued, nothing to structurally detect) just as
    cleanly as a turn that is genuinely finished. Per-session proof would
    need a fresh ``git``/``gh`` call this Board deliberately never makes on
    a poll, so ``active_issue_repos`` (see :func:`active_issue_repos`) is the
    cheap, already-fetched substitute: an ``idle-finished`` card whose repo
    still has an open issue workflow is reported ``awaiting-input`` instead
    — a coarser, repo-level check that can occasionally keep a genuinely
    finished session in view, which is exactly the asymmetry #627 asks for
    (under-claim, don't over-claim).

    Live-session cards also carry ``state_sid`` — the claimed state row's own
    key (``None`` when unmatched) — so a Slack ping's deep link, which only
    knows the hook's transcript UUID, can still resolve to the right card
    (fleet-config#242 / #307). State-only cards don't get one: they have no
    session-host id and no drawer target, so a deep link to one is out of scope.
