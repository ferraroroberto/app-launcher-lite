"""Transcript-JSONL parsing for the Board tab (issue #408 split of ``board.py``).

Claude Code's transcript files are the ground truth for three things the hook
state file can't tell you on its own:

* whether a session that's stamped ``needs-you``/``idle`` has actually
  resumed working without any hook firing (:func:`_transcript_overlay`,
  #305/#309), and whether an unmatched hook row has recent transcript
  activity that independently proves an external process still exists
  (:func:`_external_row_liveness`, #322/#455);
* whether a session stamped ``needs-you``/``idle`` is actually still waiting
  on its *own* backgrounded work — a background sub-agent or shell dispatch
  it hasn't heard back from yet (:func:`_has_pending_background_dispatch`,
  #464, hardened by #576 and #601 — see that function's docstring for why the
  original ``toolUseResult``-keyed check alone isn't reliable);
* the last completed user→assistant exchange, for the drill-down drawer
  (:func:`last_exchange`, #301).

All read only a bounded tail of the transcript (never the whole file — a
long session's JSONL can run to many MB) and degrade to "no signal" on any
IO/parse error; callers keep whatever status/state they already had.

# progress, "*" (U+2733) once it returns to an idle prompt. Verified live
# against real sessions on this box: the glyph stays a spinner throughout
# text generation *and* tool dispatch, only flipping to the idle marker once
# control returns to the user — so it is immune to #631's race (the tail
# scan landing in the ~1.8s gap between a streamed text block and its own
# following tool_use block), which is entirely a transcript-file phenomenon
# this field never touches. This is undocumented CLI UI chrome, not a

# glyph range; anything else (a future CLI's different spinner, no title
# yet, a non-Claude agent, a "remote" kind session with no PTY) falls

    already takes. It is sourced from the live PTY, not this row's
    transcript, so it is immune to the JSONL write-ordering race the rest of
    this function has to work around.

    The hooks flip status only on prompt-submit / stop / notification — but
    Claude *resumes* without any of those firing (an answered permission
    prompt or AskUserQuestion, a prompt queued into a running turn), so a
    ``needs-you``/``idle`` stamp sticks while the agent visibly works (#305).
    The transcript JSONL is ground truth: it is appended continuously during
    a turn and goes quiet on stop — and the Stop hook re-stamps the row
    *after* the final transcript write, so a genuine ``needs-you`` still wins
    immediately.

    The probe is two-stage (#309): the mtime ``os.stat`` is only a cheap
    pre-filter — post-Stop metadata lines advance mtime with no real resume —
    so when mtime clears the epsilon, :func:`_last_activity` reads the tail
    and only a real conversation line past the stamp flips the status.

    Separately (#464), :func:`_pending_background_dispatch_launched_at`
    always checks the tail for an outstanding background sub-agent/shell
    dispatch launched *before* Claude's own turn ended — a case the mtime
    pre-filter above would otherwise skip, since nothing is written to this
    transcript past the stamp until the background work's own completion
    notice lands. #608 refines this further: a dispatch outstanding past
    :data:`_STALLED_DISPATCH_AFTER` is no longer healthy waiting but a real
    anomaly, so it renders ``stalled`` instead of ``working`` — but only when
    the launch line's own timestamp actually resolved
    (:data:`_UNKNOWN_LAUNCH_STAMP` means "genuinely outstanding, age
    unknown", not "very old"; guessing stalled from that sentinel would be
    wrong far too often, per the explicit caution against a low-confidence
    stalled call). ``idle`` never gets a ``stalled`` verdict — the four-way
    split is scoped to ``needs-you``, and :func:`_refine_waiting_status` does
    the rest of that split once this function is done overriding.

    needs *how long* a dispatch has been outstanding, not just whether one
    is — see :func:`_has_pending_background_dispatch` for the full detection
    story this shares).

    A ``Stop`` hook fires (stamping ``needs-you``) the moment Claude's own
    turn ends — even when that turn dispatched a background sub-agent or
    shell command it is still waiting to hear back from. The parent
    transcript then goes quiet until the eventual ``<task-notification>``
    lands, so #305's activity check alone never catches this window (#464).
    Unlike :func:`_last_activity` this runs unconditionally, not mtime-gated:
    the dispatch's launch line sits *before* the hook's stamp, not after it,
    so the mtime pre-filter that skips a quiet tail would otherwise hide it.

    Two independent launched/completed id schemes are unioned (#576): the
    original one keyed on internal ``toolUseResult`` fields
    (:func:`_launched_background_ids` / :func:`_notified_background_ids`,
    covers backgrounded ``Bash`` via ``backgroundTaskId`` and async
    ``Agent``/``Task`` dispatches via ``isAsync``+``agentId``), and a
    narrower, more robust one for backgrounded ``Bash``/``PowerShell`` calls
    specifically, keyed on the tool call's own ``tool_use`` id
    (:func:`_launched_bash_dispatch_ids` / :func:`_notified_bash_dispatch_ids`),
    which doesn't depend on the internal result-shape field that a live
    spot-check found had drifted. Either scheme flagging a dispatch as
    still-outstanding is enough to keep the status ``working`` — a launched
    id only counts as resolved within its own scheme's id-space, so there's
    no cross-scheme false match. (The sub-agent/``Task`` path is left to the
    original scheme alone — unlike backgrounded Bash, most ``Task`` dispatches
    are ordinary *synchronous* sub-agent calls, so a tool-call-id-keyed check
    would need to tell "still running async" apart from "finished, this is
    just the normal blocking reply" and risk misreading the common case.)

    Reads :data:`_EXCHANGE_TAIL_BYTES` rather than the smaller
    ``_ACTIVITY_TAIL_BYTES`` (#594): a launch line can sit well behind one
    large intervening tool result (e.g. a file ``Read``) by the time the turn
    ends, and the 8 KB window sized for the cheap #309 mtime pre-filter was
    empirically too small to still reach it. A truncated read's first line is
    dropped — it is likely torn — matching :func:`last_exchange`'s handling
    of the same tail-read shape.

    Even :data:`_EXCHANGE_TAIL_BYTES` is still just a window, and a long
    enough turn pushes the launch line past it — a real transcript (#627,
    project-scaffolding#199's worker) dispatched a background ``Explore``
    sub-agent whose launch line sat ~299 KB from EOF by the time the turn
    ended, past this window, so the id-keyed scan below found nothing
    outstanding and the row read as a clean stop when a dispatch was still
    genuinely running. Claude Code itself reports this directly, independent
    of any byte window: the ``system``/``turn_duration`` line it appends the
    moment a turn ends carries ``pendingBackgroundAgentCount`` — the exact
    real transcript above had one such line reading ``1`` at the same instant
    the id-keyed scan below found nothing. When the scan below finds no
    outstanding stamp but the tail's last ``turn_duration`` line reports a
    nonzero count, that harness-native count wins — treated the same as
    :data:`_UNKNOWN_LAUNCH_STAMP` (genuinely outstanding, age unknown) since
    it carries no per-dispatch launch time of its own.

    A ``<task-notification>``'s ``<task-id>``/``<tool-use-id>`` tags first
    appear on a ``queue-operation`` line whose ``operation`` is ``"enqueue"``
    — that only means the background result is *ready*, not that Claude has
    received it yet. A live-transcript spot-check for #601 found a session
    where the enqueue line was the last thing written to the transcript, with
    no later ``dequeue``/``remove`` — the notification was still sitting in
    the queue, unconsumed, while the row's stale ``needs-you`` Stop stamp
    stood. So an enqueued notification is only counted as delivered once a
    *later* ``dequeue``/``remove`` operation pops it off the (FIFO) queue —
    tracked positionally, since a ``dequeue`` line carries no content of its
    own to correlate by id. Other queue traffic (e.g. a prompt typed into an
    already-running session, which rides the same enqueue/dequeue mechanism)
    occupies a queue slot too, so it is tracked untagged rather than skipped —
    skipping it would misalign a later dequeue onto the wrong notification.
    The ``attachment``-shaped notification (:func:`_notified_background_ids`'s
    other fallback) is not queue-gated: it isn't a ``queue-operation`` line at
    all, so it already represents a delivered conversation event.

    Any failure degrades to "nothing pending" — callers keep the hook status.
