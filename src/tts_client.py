"""Thin HTTP client for the local-llm-hub TTS endpoint (issue #203).

The Coding terminal's 🔊 read-aloud button can synthesize the agent's last
reply with the hub's high-quality Orpheus voice instead of the on-device Web
Speech voice. The hub exposes an OpenAI-shape ``POST /v1/audio/speech`` at
``http://127.0.0.1:8000`` that streams a WAV back when ``stream_format`` is
``"audio"`` — the webapp proxies to it over loopback so the phone never talks
to the hub directly.

Unlike the sibling voice-transcriber / photo-ocr clients, the hub binds
loopback only and serves **plain HTTP** (no self-signed TLS), so calls use
``verify=True`` (the default) and a plain ``http://`` base.

``health`` is a blocking ``requests`` call wrapped in ``asyncio.to_thread`` by
the router; the streamed synth itself is forwarded with ``httpx`` straight in
the router (mirroring the ``/api/transcribe/.../events`` SSE proxy), so this
module owns only the cheap health probe plus the URL / payload builders.
